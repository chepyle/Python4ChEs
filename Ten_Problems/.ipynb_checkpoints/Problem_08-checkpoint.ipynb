    "The batch distillation of benzene (component 1) and toluene (component 2) mixture is being car-ried out at a pressure of 1.2 atm. Initially, there are 100 moles of liquid in the still, comprised of60% benzene and 40% toluene (mole fraction basis). Calculate the amount of liquid remaining inthe still when concentration of toluene reaches 80%."
