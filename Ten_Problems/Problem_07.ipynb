    "a)Numerically solve Equation (23) with the boundary conditions of (24) and (25) for the casewhere CA0 = 0.2 kg mol/m3, k = 10-3 s-1, DAB = 1.2 10-9 m2/s, and L = 10-3 m. This solutionshould  utilized  an  ODE  solver  with  a  shooting  technique  and  employ  Newtonâ€™s  method  orsome other technique for converging on the boundary condition given by Equation (25).\n",
